## 1. Line Identity

**Form 1040 line 33** (2025):

```
Add lines 25d, 26, and 32. These are your total payments.
```

Exact formula:

```
line33 = line25d + line26 + line32
```

Line 33 is the **total payments pivot**: compared against line 24 (total tax) to determine
whether the return produces a refund (line 34 path) or an amount owed (line 37 path).

---

## 2. Top-Level Formula and Expansion

```
line33 = line25d + line26 + line32

line25d = line25a (W-2 box 2 withholding)
        + line25b (1099-series / SSA-1099 / RRB-1099 withholding)
        + line25c (W-2G box 4 + Form 8959 line 24)

line26  = quarterly estimated tax installments Q1–Q4
        + prior-year overpayment applied from original return
        + prior-year overpayment applied from amended return (Form 1040-X)

line32  = line27a (EIC)
        + line28  (ACTC)
        + line29  (Refundable AOTC)
        + line30  (Refundable adoption credit)
        + line31  (Schedule 3 line 15)
```

---

## 3. Downstream Lines 34–38

All computed within `computeLine31ThroughLine38()` (same method as line 33).

| Line | Formula | Java field | Condition |
|---|---|---|---|
| 34 | `line33 − line24` | `Refund.overpaid` | Only when `line33 > line24` |
| 35a | `line34 − line36` | `Refund.refundAmount` | Only when overpaid |
| 35b/c/d | Direct deposit routing/account | `Refund.routingNumber/.accountType/.accountNumber` | When `wantsDirectDeposit=true` |
| 36 | User-elected amount applied to 2026 est. tax (irrevocable) | `Refund.amountAppliedToNextYear` | Capped at `line34` |
| 37 | `line24 − line33` | `AmountOwed.amountOwed` | Only when `line24 > line33` |
| 38 | `Form2210.totalPenalty` | `AmountOwed.estimatedTaxPenalty` | When Form 2210 penalty > 0 and not waived |

Lines 34 and 37 are mutually exclusive. Line 38 is added **after** line 37 is set (penalty stacks on top of amount owed).

---

## 4. Backend Implementation

### Core Method

**File:** `TaxReturnComputeService.java` lines 19800–20015 (line 33 wiring at 19937-19940)

```java
// Line 33: total payments
BigDecimal line33 = roundMoney(safeAmount(totalWithholding)  // line25d
        .add(safeAmount(line26))                              // line26
        .add(safeAmount(line32)));                            // line32
payments.setTotalPayments(line33.compareTo(BigDecimal.ZERO) > 0 ? line33 : null);

// Line 34/35a/36 (overpayment path)
if (line33.compareTo(totalTax) > 0) {
    BigDecimal overpaid = roundMoney(line33.subtract(totalTax));
    refund.setOverpaid(overpaid);
    BigDecimal line36Capped = line36.min(overpaid);
    refund.setAmountAppliedToNextYear(line36Capped > 0 ? line36Capped : null);
    refund.setRefundAmount(overpaid.subtract(line36Capped) > 0 ? ... : null);
    // Direct deposit: populated from 35-direct-deposit form when !hasSplitRefund
}

// Line 37 (amount owed path)
else if (totalTax.compareTo(line33) > 0) {
    amountOwed.setAmountOwed(roundMoney(totalTax.subtract(line33)));
}
```

### Form 2210 (Line 38)

**File:** `TaxReturnComputeService.java` line 20090+

Called after `computeLine31ThroughLine38()`. When `totalPenalty > 0` and method != WAIVED:

```java
ao.setEstimatedTaxPenalty(form2210.getTotalPenalty());
ao.setAmountOwed(roundMoney(currentOwed.add(form2210.getTotalPenalty())));
```

Form 2210 computation uses **Form 1040 line 22** (`taxAfterCredits`), NOT line 18
(`totalTaxBeforeCredits`). This was a bug fixed 2026-04-19 (G1 in outstanding.md).

**Form 2210 Part I formula:**
```
Line 1 = taxAfterCredits (Form 1040 line 22)
Line 2 = otherTaxes (SE tax, AMT, Form 8959, etc.)
Line 3 = line1 + line2
Line 4 = refundable credits (EIC + ACTC + refundable AOTC + adoption)
Line 5 = max(0, line3 − line4)
Line 6 = line5 × 90%   ← 90% current-year safe harbor
Line 7 = prior-year safe harbor (100% or 110% × priorYearTax)
Line 8 = min(line6, line7)  ← required annual payment
Line 9 = totalWithholding + estimatedTaxPayments
```

**Safe harbor tiers:**
- Prior AGI ≤ $150,000: 100% of prior-year tax
- Prior AGI > $150,000: 110% of prior-year tax

**Penalty trigger:** balance due ≥ $1,000 AND safe harbors not satisfied.

**Computation methods:**
- `NO_PENALTY` — payments sufficient
- `WAIVED` — Box A full waiver (waiveFullPenalty = true)
- `REGULAR_METHOD` — 4 equal installments, withholding split equally per period

**Out of scope:** Schedule AI (Box C), Box D (actual withholding dates), Form 2210-F (farmers/fishermen), partial waiver documentation upload.

### Form 8888 (Split Refund)

**File:** `TaxReturnComputeService.java` — `computeForm8888()`

- Called after lines 33–38 are finalized
- Triggered by `refundAllocationData.wantsRefundAllocation = true`
- Up to 3 accounts; each with amount, routing number (9 digits), account type, account number
- Line 5 (totalAllocated) must equal `Refund.refundAmount` (line 35a)
- `FORM_8888_TOTAL_MISMATCH` non-blocking flag when mismatch
- Savings bond purchase line (previously line 4) discontinued for 2024+ returns

---

## 5. Frontend Implementation

**File:** `form-tax-return-1040.component.ts`

```typescript
protected line33TotalPayments(): number | null {
  const payments = this.form1040()?.payments;
  if (!payments) return null;
  const totalPayments = this.toNumber(payments.totalPayments);
  if (totalPayments !== null) return totalPayments;          // prefer stored backend value
  const line32 = this.line32OtherPayments();
  return this.sumAmounts([this.line25dTotalWithholding(), payments.estimatedTaxPayments, line32]);
}
```

The fallback client-side recompute exists for backward compatibility with older saved returns that may not have `totalPayments` stored.

**PDF fields used:**

| PDF semantic field | CSV field | Form 1040 line |
|---|---|---|
| `line33_total_payments` | `f2_29[0]` | Line 33 |
| `line34_overpaid` | — | Line 34 |
| `line35a_refund_amount` | — | Line 35a |
| `direct_deposit_routing_number` | — | Line 35b |
| `direct_deposit_account_number` | — | Line 35d |
| `direct_deposit_account_type_checking` | — | Line 35c (checkbox) |
| `direct_deposit_account_type_savings` | — | Line 35c (checkbox) |
| `line36_applied_to_2025_estimated_tax` | — | Line 36 |
| `line37_amount_you_owe` | — | Line 37 |
| `line38_estimated_tax_penalty` | — | Line 38 |

All fields are correctly mapped in the frontend as of 2026-04-21.

## 8. IRS Rules and Edge Cases

| Rule | Details |
|---|---|
| $1 minimum refund | IRS will not automatically issue a refund < $1; taxpayer must request in writing. Backend does not enforce this floor. |
| Line 36 irrevocable | Once elected, the applied amount cannot be reversed. IRS credits it to Q1 2026 installment (April 15, 2026) by default. |
| Form 8888 vs. 35b/c/d | When Form 8888 is used, lines 35b/c/d on Form 1040 are blank. The backend populates `Refund.routingNumber` etc. only when `!hasSplitRefund`. |
| Line 38 stacks on line 37 | `AmountOwed.amountOwed` = line37 + Form 2210 penalty. The penalty is a separate addend, not a replacement. |
| Refund interest | No interest due if return filed by April 15 and refund issued within 45 days. Interest accrues on owed amounts from the due date. |
| 2025 Form 2210 penalty rate | IRS short-term federal rate + 3% (compounded daily). Rate varies quarterly; Q1–Q2 2025 rate based on IRS announcements. Backend uses fixed-rate approximation. |

## 9. Compute Order

```
1.  computeLine27aEIC()              → earnedIncomeCredit (line27a)
2.  computeSchedule8812()            → additionalChildTaxCredit (line28)
3.  computeForm8863() + applyForm8863ToSchedule3()  → americanOpportunityCredit (line29)
4.  computeAdoptionBenefits() early  → refundableAdoptionCredit (tentative; line30)
5.  applyAdoptionCredit()            → confirms line30; sets Schedule 3 line 6c
6.  finalizeSchedule3Totals()        → otherPaymentsSchedule3 (line31)
7.  computeLine31ThroughLine38() {
      line25a/b/c/d aggregation
      line26 = computeLine26EstimatedTax()
      line27a = computeLine27aEIC() (final)
      line29 re-set from form8863
      line30 re-set from adoption
      line31 from schedule3.line15
      line32 = 27a+28+29+30+31
      line33 = 25d+26+32             ← LINE 33
      line34/35a/36/37 computed
    }
8.  computeForm2210()                → totalPenalty → AmountOwed.estimatedTaxPenalty (line38)
9.  computeForm8888()                → split refund allocation (after line35a finalized)
```
